### About Me

I am a postdoctoral researcher at ÉTS Montréal, working in the [Cloud-2-Edge (C2E)](https://www.juliengs.ca/) lab under the supervision of [Dr. Julien Gascon-Samson](https://www.etsmtl.ca/en/study-at-ets/professors/jgsamson). My research focuses on distributed systems, distributed machine learning, and edge computing. Before joining C2E at ÉTS, I worked at SGS-Brightsight in Delft, the Netherlands, as a hardware security evaluator. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from Grenoble Alpes University, France, in 2022, and my M.Sc. in Embedded Systems Security and Trust from Grenoble INP in 2019. I also hold a B.Sc. in Computer Software Engineering from Azad University of Tehran (South Branch), Iran, earned in 2016.

### Early Career as a Researcher

I began my research journey in Machine Learning and Deep Learning as a master's intern at the LCIS laboratory in Valence, France. Before that, I briefly explored neuromorphic computing as a master’s research assistant at IUST, where I developed a growing interest in applying machine learning to embedded systems. 

At LCIS, I focused on developing and implementing side-channel analysis techniques based on deep learning for hardware security evaluations. This work was later presented at the DATE 2020 conference. Following my master's degree at Grenoble INP, I continued as a Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering at LCIS, where I concentrated on applying machine learning and deep learning techniques to improve cryptographic data processing for constrained cyber-physical systems.

During my Ph.D., I led several projects, including the development of a methodology for ML-based authentication and enrollment of Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs), advancements in PUF modeling using transfer learning and subspace modeling, and the design of a lightweight authentication and key-exchange protocol for PUF-enabled embedded systems. 

After completing my doctorate, I briefly worked at SGS-Brightsight, where I performed industrial-grade side-channel analysis and hardware verification, before joining ÉTS as a postdoctoral researcher in 2023.

### Career as a Software Developer

Before embarking on my research career, I worked as a software developer, primarily focusing on video game development. Between 2011 and 2016, during my B.Sc. studies in Tehran, I worked part-time as a software engineer and gameplay programmer. I contributed to several small-scale mobile games at Karina Mobile Solutions and Medrick Game Studio, both based in Tehran.

I was also a founding member of an indie game development team during this period, working on various PC game titles and [developing a game design tool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLBACBFNxTE) to enhance 2D game creation in the Unity3D engine.
