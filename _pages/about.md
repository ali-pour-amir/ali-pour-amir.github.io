### About Me

I currently hold an Adjunct Professor position at the [Département de génie logiciel et des technologies de l'information](https://www.etsmtl.ca/etudier-a-lets/departements/departement-genie-logiciel-ti) (LOG-TI) at ÉTS Montréal. From late 2023 to 2025, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher with the [Cloud-2-Edge (C2E)](https://www.juliengs.ca/) lab under management and supervision of [Dr. Julien Gascon-Samson](https://www.etsmtl.ca/en/study-at-ets/professors/jgsamson). In 2023, I worked as security evaluator at [SGS-Brightsight](https://www.brightsight.com/) in Delft, the Netherlands. I received my PhD in Nanoelectronics & Nanotechnology (equivalent to Computer Engineering in North America) in 2022 from the [École doctorale
Électronique, électrotechnique, automatique, traitement du signal](https://edeeats.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/ecole-doctorale-electronique-electrotechnique-automatique-traitement-du-signal/ecole-doctorale-eeats-787822.kjsp) (EEATS) at [Grenoble Alpes University](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/english/home-628540.kjsp) (UGA) in France. During my PhD studies, I collaborated internally with UGA's [cybersecurity institute](https://cybersecurity.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/cybersecurity-institute/people), and internationally with [IS-WiN](https://sites.google.com/g.clemson.edu/is-win-lab/home) lab at [Northern Arizona University](https://nau.edu/) and [Clemson University](https://www.clemson.edu/) in the United States.

I designed the IND-520 course on [Réalisation d’une solution IdO](https://www.etsmtl.ca/en/study/courses/ind520), and taught in the summer of 2025 at ÉTS.

My research interests are:
- Information Security
- Applied Cryptography and Key-Exchange Protocols
- Homomorphic Encryption and their application in Language Models
- Authentication and Authorization in Agentic AI
- Data Privacy in Distributed Machine Learning
- Task Management and System Optimization in Federated Learning Ecosystems
- Machine Learning at the Edge
- Heuristic and Meta-Heuristic Optimization methods

### Early Career as a Researcher

I worked for 4 years as a research intern and later a research and teaching assistant at [LCIS](https://esisar.grenoble-inp.fr/en/research/lcis-laboratory). I worked on various subjects including deep learning-based side-channel analysis, and machine learning and deep learning techniques to improve cryptographic data processing for constrained cyber-physical systems.

During my Ph.D at [UGA](), I led several projects, including the development of a methodology for ML-based authentication and enrollment of Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs), advancements in PUF modeling using transfer learning and subspace modeling, and the design of a lightweight authentication and key-exchange protocol for PUF-enabled embedded systems. 

After completing my doctorate, I briefly worked at SGS-Brightsight, where I performed industrial-grade side-channel analysis and hardware verification, before joining ÉTS as a postdoctoral researcher in 2023.

### Career as a Software Developer

Before embarking on my research career, I worked as a software developer, primarily focusing on video game development. Between 2011 and 2016, during my B.Sc. studies in Tehran, I worked part-time as a software engineer and gameplay programmer. I contributed to several small-scale mobile games at Karina Mobile Solutions and Medrick Game Studio, both based in Tehran.

I was also a founding member of an indie game development team during this period, working on various PC game titles and [developing a game design tool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLBACBFNxTE) to enhance 2D game creation in the Unity3D engine.
