I am a postdoctoral researcher at ETS. I work at the Cloud-2-Edge (C2E) lab which is under supervision and management of Dr. Julien Gascon-Samson. I work on various projects related to distributed systems, distributed machine learning, and edge computing. Before joining C2E at ETS, I worked at SGS-Brightsight in Delft, the Netherlands, as a hardware security evaluator. I received my PhD in Computer Engineering from Grenoble Alpes University, Grenoble, France, in 2022, and my masters in Embedded Systems Security and Trust from Grenoble INP in 2019. I also have a B.Sc in Computer Software Engineering which I received from Azad University of Tehran (South Branch), Tehran, Iran, in 2016.
