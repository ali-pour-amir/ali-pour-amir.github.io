This is an on-going project, with the aim to be employed in SDFLMQ to enable the framework with adaptability towards the changing population in FL. The adaptability is primarily aimed to be in the topology of the connections inter-cluster-wise and intra-cluster-wise. Information on the progress in this project, and the new findings will be published here.
